    "Weather is thought to have significant impacts on human well being. Psychologically this phenomenon can be explained by Maslow's Hierarchy of needs where reliable good weather conditions can satisfy an individual's basic physiological and safety needs (1). “The evolutionary theory posits that humans have an inherent positive preference for non-threatening environmental factors in nature, which helps to promote survival and enhance well-being” (1). Light and temperature show to play a role in people's physiological and psychological state, sufficient sunlight and warm temperature are often correlated with positive emotions and mental state (1). The association between weather and well-being is due to a combination of factors, including light, temperature, air quality and several other weather conditions. The positive effect of sunlight could be due to more accessibility to the outdoors which bolsters life satisfaction (1). Sunlight has direct impacts on the production of melatonin, a hormone responsible for the regulation of the circadian rhythm and neurotransmitters associated with happiness and well-being like serotonin, dopamine, and endorphins. (1).\n",
    "\n",
    "A study (2) on SAD (seasonal affective disorder) in students examined whether a college student’s risk of developing symptoms of seasonal affective disorder is higher when they moved from a home town with minimal seasonal weather fluctuations (like Hawaii) to a university located in an area of high seasonality (like Pennsylvania). The authors hypothesized that students raised in non-seasonal environments would show larger winter increases in depressive symptoms compared to students from highly seasonal hometowns. Using an adapted version of the Seasonal Patterns Assessment Questionnaire (SPAQ) administered to 3 different universities in the fall (as baseline) and again in the winter and comparing that data to publicly available climate data, they found that nearly 50% of students from non-seasonal hometowns reported an increased SPAQ score in the winter, compared to no change for those with non-seasonal hometowns. Students from non-seasonal hometowns appear to experience greater seasonal shifts in mood and there are other adaptive factors that affect seasonal mood changes.(2).\n",
    "\n",
    "A study on the effects of weather on sleep patten has shown a “small but statistically significant effects of seasonal and weather effects on sleep patterns” (3) finding that “the strongest seasonal effects for wake time and sleep duration, especially during the spring season: wake times are earlier, and sleep duration decreases (compared to the reference season winter)” (3). “Sleep duration also modestly decreases when day lengths get longer (between the winter and summer solstice). Bedtimes and wake times tend to be slightly later as outdoor temperature increases” (3). Several demographics were controlled for including age, sex, organization, supervisory role, latitude, and longitude of home location as well as psychological traits associated with sleep using the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS X) for affect balance, Big Five Inventory (BFI) for personality, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) for sleep quality, and Morning-Eveningness Questionnaire (MEQ)107 for chronotype (3). This study shows that there is a correlation between seasonality and sleep duration with longer day lengths associated with less nightly sleep duration. For every hour increase in daylight, sleep duration decreases by 3.6 minutes. However, “the addition of weather variables (temperature, wind, and humidity/cloud cover) in the full model did not explain significantly more variance” (3).\n",
    "\n",
    "The effect of sleep duration on general health outcomes was also looked at in a study that took self reported sleep data from the a sample of US adults and categorized them into 3 groups: short sleep (≤5 hours), recommended sleep (6–8 hours), and long sleep (≥9 hours) (7). Health outcomes were measured in a variety of ways including self-reported diagnosis of depression, number of poor mental health days, number of poor physical health days, and self-rated general health, measured on a 5-point Likert scale from excellent to poor (7). The study found that short sleep duration (≤5 hours) was associated with a 14.1 percentage point increase in depression incidence (95% CI: 13.8%–14.4%), while long sleep duration (≥9 hours) was linked to a 12.9 percentage point increase (7). Both short and long sleep groups also reported having more poor mental and physical health days as well as lower self-rated general health (7). This study shows that there is a correlation between sleep duration and general mood and well-being, with the best outcomes coming from people who sleep on average 6 to 8 hours per night.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another study (3) examined whether students’ happiness (subjective well-being) predicts academic performance, and whether gender differences exist during the disruption of the COVID-19 pandemic. They used The Oxford Happiness Questionnaire (OHQ) as a self reported measure of happiness and grade point average as a measure of academic success. Data analysis revealed that higher education students in the UAE have high levels of happiness and academic success with no gender difference, indicating that students’ happiness levels were positively correlated to their academic success. (3).\n",
    "\n",
    "While many prior studies rely on surveys and psychological assessments, recent research has increasingly used large-scale behavioral datasets to examine how weather influences mood in real-world settings. Another study (4) of prior work examines weather influences on emotional states at scale using large datasets, linking environmental conditions to expressed sentiment and mood beyond traditional survey methods. For example, one large analysis of 3.5 billion social media posts from Facebook and Twitter found that multiple weather variables like temperature, precipitation, humidity, and cloud cover, were strongly associated with the sentiment expressed in people’s posts. Adverse weather conditions correspond to more negative emotional expression in its data (4). Similarly, a global study of 1.2 billion social media posts across 157 countries observed that extremely high temperatures were associated with more negative moods. In other words, climate variables were found to be related to mood at the global level (5). Recent research using computational methods has improved the way that language and regional variations are taken into account when examining the relationship between weather and sentiment on social media. The research points to the complex relationship that weather has with mood and the importance of using context-sensitive analysis when examining data (6). These studies show that data science techniques are effective in examining the relationship that weather has with mood and that similar techniques could be used in our project.\n",

    "We predict that as the average weekly temperature increases, self-reported levels of anxiety and depression will go down in university students (signifying lower levels of anxiety and depression). We also predict that as the average weekly temperature decreases, self-reported anxiety or depressive feelings questionnaire scores will increase (signifying higher levels of anxiety and depression). We predict that lower average weekly temperatures will also increase sleep duration and that there is an association between sleep duration and self-reported depression and anxiety ratings.\n",
    "\n",
    "We believe this hypothesis because of the current accepted theory that sunlight affects the circadian rhythm, which in turn has an effect on mood regulation and, by extension, levels of self-reported depression and anxiety (1) as well as the individual studies relating climate patterns and SAD rates in university students (2). We believe that there is a negative association between temperature and sleep patterns, with lower temperatures increasing average sleep duration because lower temperatures limit the appeal and availability of outside activities and are usually associated with “poor weather,” which increases the likelihood of students staying inside and therefore provides more opportunity for sleep. Lastly, we believe that there will be an association with sleep times and self-reported depression and anxiety ratings due to studies (2) findings that people who sleep more or less than 6-8 hours report higher levels of depression.\n",

    "**Update notes:** Hypothesis was also updated to reflect change in research question. We are no longer investigating academic performance and now making predictions regarding weather's effect on depression/anxiety and sleep."

    "    - The Open-Mateo Historical Forecast API provides an hourly historical record of temperature in Seattle, Washington. This dataset consists of 3 sub-sets, each sub-sets contain hourly Seattle weather data from spring to summer in 2019-2021 measured in Fahrenheit. Weather data are from weather stations, satellites, radar, airplanes, soundings, and buoys. With high update frequencies of 1, 3, or 6 hours, the resulting time series is nearly as accurate as direct measurements and offers global coverage. The specific date of the dataset is also selected according to the sleep data and anxiety and depression data from GLOBEM dataset.\n",
    "  - Descriptions of any shortcomings this dataset has with repsect to the project\n",
    "    - A primary concern of this dataset is the presence of extreme climatic outliers due to significant climate change. Some extreme weather occurs and creates statistical skew. Moreover, since the dataset does not include variables such as precipitation or cloud cover, it does not provide a complete picture of overall weather conditions. For instance, on weather forecasts, the 'feels like' temperature often differs from the actual air temperature, which may affect how participants feel about the weather and affect their sleep or mental health. Additionally, because most historical weather APIs source their data from Sea-Tac Airport, the recorded temperatures may differ by several degrees from those observed in downtown Seattle or other neighborhoods. Participants from different districts may feel differently, affecting their performance on self-report questionnaires. In addition, the temperature data is measured in hours, which is too specific and not necessary for our project."

    "The sleep dataset contains passively collected daily sleep metrics from sleep-related features from RAPIDS-Fitbit-Sleep collected from undergraduate students from the University of Washington between the years of 2018-2021 as part of multi-year mobile and wearable sensing dataset (GLOBEM). The primary variable that is relevant for this project is the nightly sleep duration for main sleep episodes. Main sleep episodes refer to the primary nighttime sleep period and exclude naps from total sleep duration. This is stored in the sumdurationasleepmain feature, which contains the total sleep duration for a certain sleep type during a time segment recorded in minutes. For undergraduate university-age students, the average recommended sleep duration is around 7-9 hours per night (420-590 minutes). Values consistently below 6 hours indicate potential for sleep deprivation, and values consistently over 9 or 10 hours may indicate hypersomnia.\n",
    "\n",
    "Major concerns with this dataset is the fact that sleep duration is inferred from the Fitbit device data instead of being clinically measured, which means that sleep duration estimates are more prone to error if the devices are not worn or are inactive. Missingness from data may not be random if participants forgot or disabled their devices. This tracking device also does not capture sleep duration quality. In addition, each year has portions of missing sleep data from participants during periods of time. This may affect results."

    "### Seattle Historical Weather Dataset\n",
    "This dataset provides a hourly historical record of temperature in Seattle, Washington.This dataset consists of 3 subsets, 2019 historical weather data includes temperature data from March 21 to June 25 in 2019, historical weather data in 2020 included temperature data from March 16 to June 16 in this year and historical weather data in 2021 includes temperature data from March 29 to July 9 in this year. The only variable included is temperature measured in degrees Fahrenheit (°F). Because temperature is the only variable included, this dataset focuses exclusively on thermal patterns without accompanying information about precipitation, wind, humidity, or atmospheric pressure. Air temperature in °F reflects how hot or cold the air is at the time of measurement.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Seattle’s marine climate, typical spring temperatures range from about 45–55°F, while summer temperatures generally range from 60–85°F. Values above 90°F are relatively uncommon and may indicate a heatwave, while temperatures below 32°F indicate freezing conditions. Extremely high temperatures (e.g., above 100°F) are rare but potentially dangerous, increasing the risk of heat exhaustion and heat stroke. In addition,temperatures below 20°F would be considered unusually cold for Seattle and could pose risks and safety concerns.\n",
    "\n",
    "A primary concern of this dataset is the presence of extreme climatic outliers due to significant climate change. For instance, the June 2021 Pacific Northwest Heat Dome. During this event, the temperature is rising sharply, reaching above 90°F, which creates a significant statistical skew. Moreover, since the dataset does not include variables such as precipitation or cloud cover, it does not provide a complete picture of overall weather conditions. For example, a 45°F day in Seattle can feel very different depending on whether it is bright and sunny or marked by the city’s characteristic gray skies and light mist. Additionally, because most historical weather APIs source their data from Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, the recorded temperatures may differ by several degrees from those observed in other part of the city."

    "### A. Data Collection\n",
    " - \\[X\\] **A.1 Informed consent**: If there are human subjects, have they given informed consent, where subjects affirmatively opt-in and have a clear understanding of the data uses to which they consent?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Subjects were recruited and compensated for their participation in studies. Participation was voluntary and consent forms were signed.\n",
    "\n",
    " - \\[X\\] **A.2 Collection bias**: Have we considered sources of bias that could be introduced during data collection and survey design and taken steps to mitigate those?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Subjects were all university students which classifies them as WEIRD subjects. Research question formulated to be specific to only university students.\n",
    "\n",
    " - \\[X\\] **A.3 Limit PII exposure**: Have we considered ways to minimize exposure of personally identifiable information (PII) for example through anonymization or not collecting information that isn't relevant for analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    "> IRB rules were followed to anonymize participant data. Only feature-level data was released to protect privacy.\n",
    "\n",
    " - \\[X\\] **A.4 Downstream bias mitigation**: Have we considered ways to enable testing downstream results for biased outcomes (e.g., collecting data on protected group status like race or gender)?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Our group does not have access to demographics information as it is protected and needs to be specially requested therefore we are unable to directly evaluate whether our downstream analyses produce disparate outcomes across protected groups. We acknowledge this constraint and avoid making claims about demographic disparities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### B. Data Storage\n",
    " - \\[X\\] **B.1 Data security**: Do we have a plan to protect and secure data (e.g., encryption at rest and in transit, access controls on internal users and third parties, access logs, and up-to-date software)?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Some of the data used is publicly available government information. Restricted data will be used strictly for analytical and modeling purposes. Models will be published but data will not be released.\n",
    "\n",
    " - \\[X\\] **B.2 Right to be forgotten**: Do we have a mechanism through which an individual can request their personal information be removed?\n",
    " - \\[X\\] **B.3 Data retention plan**: Is there a schedule or plan to delete the data after it is no longer needed?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Data will be deleted off of local drives after this project is completed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### C. Analysis\n",
    " - \\[X\\] **C.1 Missing perspectives**: Have we sought to address blindspots in the analysis through engagement with relevant stakeholders (e.g., checking assumptions and discussing implications with affected communities and subject matter experts)?\n",
    "\n",
    "> While not engaging directly with relevant stakeholders, we sought to mitigate blind spots by reviewing the literature on the use of PHQ-4 which we will use as our measure for anxiety and depression scores. By reviewing similar studies to ours we have found that the PHQ-4 is a valid self reported measure of anxiety and depression. We will not be interpreting PHQ-4 scores for clinical diagnosis.\n",
    "\n",
    " - \\[X\\] **C.2 Dataset bias**: Have we examined the data for possible sources of bias and taken steps to mitigate or address these biases (e.g., stereotype perpetuation, confirmation bias, imbalanced classes, or omitted confounding variables)?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Potential sources of bias could come from self reported longitudinal data on anxiety and depression which may be a source of reporting bias stigma, or survey fatigue. Because of this we will not be using this data as a diagnostic tool for participants but rather interpret it as a screening tool. There is also potential for attrition bias due to the duration of the study that we have taken into account. Because of the lack of demographic information and contextual variables, we will refrain from making casual interpretations.\n",
    "\n",
    " - \\[X\\] **C.3 Honest representation**: Are our visualizations, summary statistics, and reports designed to honestly represent the underlying data?\n",
    " - \\[X\\] **C.4 Privacy in analysis**: Have we ensured that data with PII are not used or displayed unless necessary for the analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Personal identifiers are not provided in the original data set.\n",
    "\n",
    " - \\[X\\] **C.5 Auditability**: Is the process of generating the analysis well documented and reproducible if we discover issues in the future?\n",
    "\n",
    "> All of our steps are well documented with ample commentary for future reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "### D. Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "As we are not planning on creating a model, these questions do not significantly apply to our project.\n",
    " - \\[X\\] **D.1 Proxy discrimination**: Have we ensured that the model does not rely on variables or proxies for variables that are unfairly discriminatory?\n",
    " - \\[X\\] **D.2 Fairness across groups**: Have we tested model results for fairness with respect to different affected groups (e.g., tested for disparate error rates)?\n",
    " - \\[X\\] **D.3 Metric selection**: Have we considered the effects of optimizing for our defined metrics and considered additional metrics?\n",
    " - \\[X\\] **D.4 Explainability**: Can we explain in understandable terms a decision the model made in cases where a justification is needed?\n",
    " - \\[X\\] **D.5 Communicate limitations**: Have we communicated the shortcomings, limitations, and biases of the model to relevant stakeholders in ways that can be generally understood?\n",
    "\n",
    "### E. Deployment\n",
    "\n",
    "As we are not planning on creating a model, these questions do not significantly apply to our project.\n",
    " - \\[X\\] **E.1 Monitoring and evaluation**: Do we have a clear plan to monitor the model and its impacts after it is deployed (e.g., performance monitoring, regular audit of sample predictions, human review of high-stakes decisions, reviewing downstream impacts of errors or low-confidence decisions, testing for concept drift)?\n",
    " - \\[X\\] **E.2 Redress**: Have we discussed with our organization a plan for response if users are harmed by the results (e.g., how does the data science team evaluate these cases and update analysis and models to prevent future harm)?\n",
    " - \\[X\\] **E.3 Roll back**: Is there a way to turn off or roll back the model in production if necessary?\n",
    " - \\[X\\] **E.4 Unintended use**: Have we taken steps to identify and prevent unintended uses and abuse of the model and do we have a plan to monitor these once the model is deployed?\n"
