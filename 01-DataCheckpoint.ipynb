    "Weather is thought to have significant impacts on human well being. Psychologically this phenomenon can be explained by Maslow's Hierarchy of needs where reliable good weather conditions can satisfy an individual's basic physiological and safety needs (1). “The evolutionary theory posits that humans have an inherent positive preference for non-threatening environmental factors in nature, which helps to promote survival and enhance well-being” (1). Light and temperature show to play a role in people's physiological and psychological state, sufficient sunlight and warm temperature are often correlated with positive emotions and mental state (1). The association between weather and well-being is due to a combination of factors, including light, temperature, air quality and several other weather conditions. The positive effect of sunlight could be due to more accessibility to the outdoors which bolsters life satisfaction (1). Sunlight has direct impacts on the production of melatonin, a hormone responsible for the regulation of the circadian rhythm and neurotransmitters associated with happiness and well-being like serotonin, dopamine, and endorphins. (1). \n",
    "\n",
    "A study (2) on SAD (seasonal affective disorder) in students examined whether a college student’s risk of developing symptoms of seasonal affective disorder is higher when they moved from a home town with minimal seasonal weather fluctuations (like Hawaii) to a university located in an area of high seasonality (like Pennsylvania). The authors hypothesized that students raised in non-seasonal environments would show larger winter increases in depressive symptoms compared to students from highly seasonal hometowns. Using an adapted version of the Seasonal Patterns Assessment Questionnaire (SPAQ) administered to 3 different universities in the fall (as baseline) and again in the winter and comparing that data to publicly available climate data, they found that nearly 50% of students from non-seasonal hometowns reported an increased SPAQ score in the winter, compared to no change for those with non-seasonal hometowns. Students from non-seasonal hometowns appear to experience greater seasonal shifts in mood and there are other adaptive factors that affect seasonal mood changes.(2).\n",
    "\n",
    "A study on the effects of weather on sleep patten has shown a “small but statistically significant effects of seasonal and weather effects on sleep patterns” (3) finding that “the strongest seasonal effects for wake time and sleep duration, especially during the spring season: wake times are earlier, and sleep duration decreases (compared to the reference season winter)” (3). “Sleep duration also modestly decreases when day lengths get longer (between the winter and summer solstice). Bedtimes and wake times tend to be slightly later as outdoor temperature increases” (3). Several demographics were controlled for including age, sex, organization, supervisory role, latitude, and longitude of home location as well as psychological traits associated with sleep using the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS X) for affect balance, Big Five Inventory (BFI) for personality, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) for sleep quality, and Morning-Eveningness Questionnaire (MEQ)107 for chronotype (3). This study shows that there is a correlation between seasonality and sleep duration with longer day lengths associated with less nightly sleep duration. For every hour increase in daylight, sleep duration decreases by 3.6 minutes. However, “the addition of weather variables (temperature, wind, and humidity/cloud cover) in the full model did not explain significantly more variance” (3). \n",
    "\n",
    "The effect of sleep duration on general health outcomes was also looked at in a study that took self reported sleep data from the a sample of US adults and categorized them into 3 groups: short sleep (≤5 hours), recommended sleep (6–8 hours), and long sleep (≥9 hours) (7). Health outcomes were measured in a variety of ways including self-reported diagnosis of depression, number of poor mental health days, number of poor physical health days, and self-rated general health, measured on a 5-point Likert scale from excellent to poor (7). The study found that short sleep duration (≤5 hours) was associated with a 14.1 percentage point increase in depression incidence (95% CI: 13.8%–14.4%), while long sleep duration (≥9 hours) was linked to a 12.9 percentage point increase (7). Both short and long sleep groups also reported having more poor mental and physical health days as well as lower self-rated general health (7). This study shows that there is a correlation between sleep duration and general mood and well-being, with the best outcomes coming from people who sleep on average 6 to 8 hours per night.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Another study (3) examined whether students’ happiness (subjective well-being) predicts academic performance, and whether gender differences exist during the disruption of the COVID-19 pandemic. They used The Oxford Happiness Questionnaire (OHQ) as a self reported measure of happiness and grade point average as a measure of academic success. Data analysis revealed that higher education students in the UAE have high levels of happiness and academic success with no gender difference, indicating that students’ happiness levels were positively correlated to their academic success. (3). \n",
    "\t\n",
    "While many prior studies rely on surveys and psychological assessments, recent research has increasingly used large-scale behavioral datasets to examine how weather influences mood in real-world settings. Another study (4) of prior work examines weather influences on emotional states at scale using large datasets, linking environmental conditions to expressed sentiment and mood beyond traditional survey methods. For example, one large analysis of 3.5 billion social media posts from Facebook and Twitter found that multiple weather variables like temperature, precipitation, humidity, and cloud cover, were strongly associated with the sentiment expressed in people’s posts. Adverse weather conditions correspond to more negative emotional expression in its data (4). Similarly, a global study of 1.2 billion social media posts across 157 countries observed that extremely high temperatures were associated with more negative moods. In other words, climate variables were found to be related to mood at the global level (5). Recent research using computational methods has improved the way that language and regional variations are taken into account when examining the relationship between weather and sentiment on social media. The research points to the complex relationship that weather has with mood and the importance of using context-sensitive analysis when examining data (6). These studies show that data science techniques are effective in examining the relationship that weather has with mood and that similar techniques could be used in our project.\n",

    "We predict that as the average weekly temperature increases, self-reported levels of anxiety and depression will go down in university students (signifying lower levels of anxiety and depression). We also predict that as the average weekly temperature decreases, self-reported anxiety or depressive feelings questionnaire scores will increase (signifying higher levels of anxiety and depression). We predict that lower average weekly temperatures will also increase sleep duration and that there is an association between sleep duration and self-reported depression and anxiety ratings. \n",
    "\n",
    "We believe this hypothesis because of the current accepted theory that sunlight affects the circadian rhythm, which in turn has an effect on mood regulation and, by extension, levels of self-reported depression and anxiety (1) as well as the individual studies relating climate patterns and SAD rates in university students (2). We believe that there is a negative association between temperature and sleep patterns, with lower temperatures increasing average sleep duration because lower temperatures limit the appeal and availability of outside activities and are usually associated with “poor weather,” which increases the likelihood of students staying inside and therefore provides more opportunity for sleep. Lastly, we believe that there will be an association with sleep times and self-reported depression and anxiety ratings due to studies (2) findings that people who sleep more or less than 6-8 hours report higher levels of depression.  \n"

This sample is likely biased because of that self-selection. These people own smartphones and may be healthier and may have more disposable income than the average person.
